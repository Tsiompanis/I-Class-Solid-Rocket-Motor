Then the mixture is weighed with a precision scale and thoroughly mixed with an electric tumbler.\n\n\\subsection{Ignition Primer}\n\\par\nThe grains are to be coated with an ignition primer so that ignition happens instantly throughout the motor to have a steeper pressure increase thus having a more flat thrust curve instead of a \"spike\" that can be seen in many KNSB motors.\\\\\nIgnition primer consists of:\n\n\\begin{center}\n\\begin{tabular}{||c c||} \n \\hline\n Ingredients: & Percentage\\\\ [0.5ex] \n \\hline\\hline\n Potassium Nitrate & 80\\%\\\\ \n \\hline\n Carbon Powder & 20\\%\\\\\n \\hline\n\\end{tabular}\n\\end{center}\n\\vspace{0.3 cm}\nTo this mixture, isopropyl alcohol is added until the mixture gets to a thin, paint-like consistency and then it is brushed onto all exposed grain surfaces and is left to dry for at least 24 hours.\n\n\n\n\\section{Grain Design, Spacers, Inhibition \\& Thermal Liner}\n\n\\begin{center}\n\\begin{tabular}{|||c c|||} \n \\hline\n Outer Diameter: & 32 mm\\\\\n \\hline\n Core Diameter: & 15 mm\\\\\n \\hline\n Length: & 60 mm\\\\\n \\hline\n\\end{tabular}\n\\end{center}\n\\vspace{0.3 cm}\nThe grain length was chosen to be 60mm to get a neutral thrust-time curve and to follow the average grain length/diameter for 38mm solid rocket motors (around 2).\n\n\\subsection{Casting}\nAfter the propellant has been mixed it is poured into a non-stick milk pot with a spout that is heated to 125\176C. Then it is mixed with a silicone spatula until fully melted. When fully melted the SLES must be added and stirred to reduce the viscosity of the mixture to facilitate easier casting. When all of this is done, the propellant is poured into the casting tubes that have the inhibitor and core rod already placed in them. The coring rod must be lined with rice paper to make it easier to demould the grain. After pouring the molten propellant, the pressure ring must be added to cure the grain under pressure to avoid air pockets and voids inside the grains.\n\n\n\\subsection{Curing}\nThe grains are left to cure and harden for 5 days in an air-tight box with desiccant bags. After the grains have fully cured they should be density checked for voids and air. The target density ratio is \\(>\\)0.95\n\n\\subsection{Grain Spacers}\nThis design uses rubber O-Rings for spacers, specifically 28mm ID, 3mm thickness O-Rings.\n\\subsection{Inhibition}\nThe inhibitor is a two-ply poster-board glued to create a hollow cylinder.\n\\subsection{Thermal Liner}\nThe thermal liner is again a two-ply poster-board but this time a thin layer of lacquer is applied in the inner surface to eliminate charring. \n\n\n\\section{Casing}\nThe material for the motor casing was chosen to be 6063-T6 Aluminum mainly because of its high tensile strength and for its relative availability.\\\\\nThe outer diameter is 38 mm to fit with readily available motor tubes for rockets. With a thickness of 2 mm the inner diameter comes out to 34 mm.\\\\\nUsing Barlow's formula\n\\[P=2\\cdot S\\cdot \\frac{t}{D}\\]\nwhere $P$ is the maximum pressure that the casing can handle (MPa), $S$ is the tensile strength of the casing material (MPa), which in this case is Aluminum-6063-T6, $t$ is the wall thickness of the casing (mm) and $D$ is the outer diameter (mm).\\\\\nWe can calculate that the bursting point of the casing comes to 26.3 MPa so by knowing the MEOP of the system to be 3.67 MPa we can calculate that the safety factor comes out to 7.2.\n\n\\section{Bulkhead}\nThe bulkhead will also be machined from aluminum 6063-T6 and will be \"free floating\" inside the motor held by a retaining ring.\\\\\nSealing will be achieved with two O-Rings.\n\\subsection{Retaining ring - Bulkhead}\nThe Bulkhead will be held inside the motor with an internal retaining ring.\\\\\nA Thing to consider about retaining rings when designing cases is that -most of the times- if you push them to their limits the groove will fail before the retaining ring itself does.\\\\\nWe can calculate the failing point of the retaining ring itself with the formula given below:\n\n\\[Rs=D\\cdot T\\cdot Ss\\cdot\\pi\\]\nWhere $Rs$ is the maximum allowable load for the retaining ring (N), $D$ is the housing diameter (mm) and $Ss$ is the shear strength of the material of the retaining ring (MPa)\\\\\n\\\\\nUsing this formula we can calculate that the retaining ring will fail at 157 kN of force. If we calculate for pressure (dividing the force by the area of the bulkhead) we can see that the motor has to reach a pressure of 172.94 MPa for the retaining ring of the bulkhead to fail. This result raises the problem that if the motor over-pressurizes that the casing will fail before the bulkhead thus becoming a pipe bomb which would be quite dangerous. But as was stated above, the groove that the retaining ring sits into will fail with a lot less force than what is needed to break the retaining ring itself.\\\\\nWe can calculate the force needed for the groove to fail with the formula given below:\n\\[G=\\frac{D\\cdot d\\cdot Gy\\cdot \\pi}{q}\\]\nWhere $G$ is the maximum allowable load for the groove (N), $D$ is the housing diameter (mm), $d$ is the depth of the groove (mm), $Gy$ is the yield strength of the groove material (MPa), and $q$ is the \"decreasing factor\", a value obtained from the value $n/d$ using the graph below:\n\\begin{center}\n\\includegraphics[width=0.4\\textwidth]{q.png}\n\\end{center}\nWhere $n$ is the edge margin of the groove and $d$ is the depth of the groove as shown below:\n\\begin{center}\n\\includegraphics[width=0.3\\textwidth]{nd.png}\n\\end{center}\nWe can now calculate that the load needed for the bulkhead retaining ring groove to fail is 12.11 kN, to reach that, the chamber pressure has to be 13.3 MPa, which produces a safety factor of 3.63. This pressure is well below the 26.31 MPa that the casing needs in order to break, helping us ensure that in case of over-pressurization the bulkhead will fail before the casing.\n\n\n\\section{Nozzle}\nThe nozzle will be made from mild steel with 15 degree convergent half-angle and 40 degree divergent half-angle and a throat diameter of 10.6 mm.\\\\\nThe optimal expansion ratio for the nozzle was calculated to be 7 with the equation below:\n\\[\\frac{\\mathrm{A}_{ }^{\\ast} }{\\mathrm{A}_{e}^{}}=\\left( \\frac{k+1}{2} \\right)^{\\frac{1}{k-1}}\\left( \\frac{\\mathrm{P}_{e}^{}}{\\mathrm{p}_{o}^{}} \\right)^{\\frac{1}{k}}\\sqrt{\\left( \\frac{k+1}{k-1} \\right)\\left[ 1-\\left( \\frac{\\mathrm{P}_{e}^{}}{\\mathrm{P}_{o}^{}} \\right)^{\\frac{k-1}{k}} \\right]} \\]\nwhere $\\mathrm{A}_{ }^{\\ast}$ is the throat area of the nozzle ($mm^2$), $\\mathrm{A}_{ }^{e}$ is the exit area of the nozzle ($mm^2$), $\\mathrm{P}_{e}^{}$ is the exit pressure ($atm$), $\\mathrm{P}_{o }^{}$ is the chamber pressure ($atm$) and finally $k$ is the ratio of specific heats of the exhaust products.\\\\\n\\\\\nThe loss of performance due to the straight-cut region in the nozzle was calculated and deemed to be insignificant for the design of this motor (1 sec. of specific impulse lost for 3 mm throat length)\\\\\n\\\\\nSealing will be achieved with two O-Rings.\n\n\\subsection{Retaining ring - Nozzle}\nUtilizing the same formulas used for the bulkhead we can calculate that the groove of the nozzle's retaining ring needs a load of 17.55 $kN$ in order to fail, calculating for pressure, the chamber has to reach 14.9 $MPa$ in order for the retaining ring groove to give in and break. We can observe that the groove of the nozzle needs 1.6 MPa \\textit{more} pressure in order to fail, that is favorable because the nozzle is harder to machine than the bulkhead.\n\n\n\\section{Ignition}\nFor the ignition a simple blackpowder pyrolant will be used placed inside a drinking straw with a 10 mm section of nichrome (nickel-chromium) wire. The blackpowder will be packed tightly inside the straw and then silicone will be used to seal the whole igniter. \n\n\\subsection{Igniter Amount \\& Pressure Rise Due to Igniter and Primer}\nCalculations for the amount of blackpowder used are TBD. The goal is when the ignition occurs that the ingiter and ignition primer gasses do not exceed the MEOP of the motor (3.67 MPa)\\\\\nI am now calculating the mass per area that the ignition primer can coat so i can calculate the pressure rise due to the primer to then calculate how much pressure there is left over for the igniter to finally calculate the igniter mass.\n\n\n\\section{Performance Graphs}\n\\subsection{Chamber Pressure}\n\\begin{center}\n\\includegraphics[width=0.5\\textwidth]{Pressure-Time.png}\n\\end{center}\n\\subsection{Thrust}\n\\begin{center}\n\\includegraphics[width=0.5\\textwidth]{thrust-time.png}\n\\end{center}\n\n\n\\section{Drawings \\& Renders}\n\\subsection{Assembly}\n\\begin{center}\n\\includegraphics[width=0.5\\textwidth]{assembly render.png}\n\\end{center}\n\\begin{center}\n\\includegraphics[width=0.5\\textwidth]{assy.png}\n\\end{center}\n\\subsection{Nozzle}\n\\begin{center}\n\\includegraphics[width=0.3\\textwidth]{nozzle-cross.png}\n\\end{center}\n\\begin{center}\n\\includegraphics[width=0.5\\textwidth]{Nozzle-Render.png}\n\\end{center}\n\\subsection{Bulkhead}\n\\begin{center}\n\\includegraphics[width=0.5\\textwidth]{Bulkhead-cross.png}\n\\end{center}\n\\begin{center}\n\\includegraphics[width=0.5\\textwidth]{Bulkhead.png}\n\\end{center}\n\n\n\\end{document}"
